#This is a basic CLI python Application to add New Card to Trello Board. 

#To run the application

1. Configure you key and token in conf.py file.

2. use main.py file to add a card.

When you run main.py you'll be asked for following information through command line 
1. Card name
2. List name or the column name on your Trello board 
3. Label for new card (Since I don't have defined label names, I've used color instead)
4. Comment for new card.

I have used click library for CLI with python.

If at anytime you need to see the options available, just use --help to see the options.

The total time I took for this task is around 6 hours.

Next development steps for this program can be making everything through Command line, right from creating a board,adding members and updating cards and members.

Also future work includes error handling wherever possible and logging for all successfull attempts.



example:
```
python3 main.py 
New Card: democard
Column of the board: Done
label: red
comment: anything
```
